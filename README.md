# 42_Piscine

The codes you see here are from my August 2024 Piscine, during which I successfully earned a place in the main cursus at 42 İstanbul. In some projects, you may notice certain files (especially the final versions) are missing if you’re currently in the Piscine. I recommend looking at these codes only as a last resort. Push yourself to figure things out on your own first; checking these solutions too early can prevent you from learning the skills you’ll need to pass the exams.

Beyond the projects, the most important advice I can give is: don’t be shy. If you're unsure about something, ask the person next to you before turning to Google. Try to meet new people as much as you can. And one last thing: have some fun.
