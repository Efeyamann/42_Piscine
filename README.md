# 42_Piscine

The codes you see here are from my August 2024 Piscine, during which I successfully earned a place in the main cursus at 42 İstanbul. In some projects, you may notice that certain files (likely the final versions) are missing if you're in the Piscine and looking for them. This is because I didn’t complete those parts. I recommend looking at these codes only as a last resort. Push yourself to figure things out on your own first; checking these solutions too early can prevent you from developing the skills you’ll need to pass the exams.

Beyond the projects, the most important advice I can give is: don’t be shy. If you're unsure about something, ask the person next to you before turning to Google. Try to meet as many people as you can. And one last thing: have some fun.
